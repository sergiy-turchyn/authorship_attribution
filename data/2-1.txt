Game of Thrones in a theater?

I'm working my way through a second viewing of Season 5 of Game of Thrones, preparing for the premiere of Season 6, this next Sunday, in the midst of a veritable feast of interesting TV viewing.

True, Better Call Saul and American Crime Story have now finished their runs, but The Americans is still going. And I have the NBA playoffs to entertain in lulls between controversies and primaries and delegate shenanigans of the American political season. No shortage of entertainment.

Back to Game of Thrones. How about bringing back the idea of a serial in movie theaters. I would pay good money to go see Game of Thrones in a real theater with big sound and on a big screen. Maybe not for the original run of a show, but for a second viewing?

Game of Thrones is the kind of show that's better on a big screen, which many of us have now. But a really big screen? That might be incredible.

Just an idea.

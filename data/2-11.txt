What Dems can do with control of Congress

The opportunity for the Dems is to motor through the problems left from the last time they had control of Congress and the White House.

To really pull it off the Dems need a super-majority in the Senate. A filibuster-proof majority.

Start by tuning up the Affordable Care Act.

Appoint a judge to the Supreme Court who's as progressive as Scalia was conservative.

And with Russ Feingold back in the Senate we have a great guy to lead the new McCain-Feingold that undoes Citizens United. And beyond. 

The NRA won't be calling the shots so we can start getting some reasonable gun control legislation. 

You want Glass-Stiegel? Let's do it.

A bill reforming student debt, as HRC has outlined it. (A very reasonable plan, imho.)

Last time the Dems had control of Congress and the White House, for two years only, they were handicapped by a President who, thinking he was transformational, tried to work with the Repubs. This time, with Clinton as President, it seems safe to assume she won't make that mistake. 

Even so a lot of good was done in those two years. 

There would be more progress than there has been since FDR and LBJ.

This should be the plan. This is what we all should be marching to, assuming you're not into the agenda of Trumps or the Kochs.

Speaking Topics For 2016: Business (R)Evolution, Culture 2.0, Innovation, Experience, Digital, WTF


I¬∞√òve been speaking professionally for just over 10 years and I¬∞√òve learned many things along the way. One lesson though stands at the top, which is no matter how much I think I know, I must always keep learning.  Like everyone and everything, I must compete for relevance now and in the future by re-thinking and re-imagining my purpose and the value I hope offer others. So, once a year, I take time to reflect on what¬∞√òs important and also what¬∞√òs stirring ahead. This time of year is perfect to assess my platform for the year ahead and I wanted to share it with you here.

While I still talk about topics that helped get me to where I am today, I continue to add chapters to the portfolio of expertise. In fact, for those who don¬∞√òt know, I have a new book out and it will be part of my program for years to come. This helps me think through topics that help those who work in event planning for conferences, meetings or festivals, those looking for speakers to engage executives employees or anyone seeking a fresh, human, and rousing voice to push people out of the comfort zones.

If you need a speaker or want to work with me, please contact me here.

Cheers!

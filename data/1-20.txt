About Me

Full-time student/language-learner/waiter/musician/traveler

My name is Dan.

I’m a University student from Melbourne, Australia, studying Law and Arts with a Chinese major.

I’ve been in love with languages ever since I spent a semester living with a French family back in High School. I think everyone should speak another language. It will expand your mind, improve your job prospects, get you more friends, get you babes (if you speak a cool language), and more. The benefits are infinite. I can speak English, French, Spanish, and Chinese, with varying ability.

I believe that enjoying the learning process and engaging with the target language’s culture is the key to properly learning it.

This blog will document my experience learning Chinese, my techniques, resources, inspiration, and, later, when I’m in China for a semester – cultural tidbits about the country’s amazing, and amazingly different, culture.

For more, see my longer introduction in my first post here.

I’m gonna go ahead and pretend you care about my life.

Welcome to Chinese-Breeze!

This is where I’m going to document my language learning adventure with Chinese. And provide all you lucky people with my indispensable advice! *cool your jets, it’s sarcasm*

Why am I writing all this? Who do I think I am? 

Firstly, because I love the sound of my own voice! Or writing, or whatever.

Actually, no. Although it may seem that way, I am writing this blog equally to benefit those attempting to learn this amazing but troublesome language, and as a travel blog to record my time in China for my friends and family, and for myself to read back over when I’m old and senile.

I am probably not remotely qualified to tell you how to learn Chinese specifically, however, I do have a fair bit of experience with learning other languages. I can currently speak English, French, Spanish, and Chinese with varying ability.

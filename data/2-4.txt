The Bernie Sanders Show

I don't like watching the political debates, I really don't. But last night was all Bernie Sanders. He probably thought he was being tough. What I saw was a clown.

I would like it if the debaters and the audience had more of a commitment to listening and not being such fans about it. The audience sounded like the reporters at an Apple keynote, with people cheering nothing, going for cheap shots, when all the issues they discussed were fairly complicated, as all public policy topics are. Apple's products aren't as good as the audience makes them sound, and neither is Sanders. It's actually kind of a parody. 

Look he very clearly has benefited politically from the support of the NRA. The same way he wants us to assume HRC is controlled by the banking industry, apply the same logic to Bernie. His whole schpiel is -- I'm honest, she's a whore. You know how that usually goes don't you? You are what you accuse. 

He's also incredibly rude. not just to HRC but to me. I don't like the way he moves his hands, esp when HRC is speaking. If you watch what she's doing as he speaks even if he's excoriating her, she looks at him attentively, motionless, soundless. Bernie just can't stop laughing, groaning, waving his hands, rolling his eyes. Remember Al Gore in debates with George Bush? Like that. It's cheating. We listen to you Bernie. You may not feel you have to be fair to your opponent, but you're penalizing voters just as much. Really not a sound campaign tactic when there are undecided people in the audience.

I found it helped when HRC was speaking to put my hand over Bernie's image on the TV so I could listen carefully to what she was saying.
